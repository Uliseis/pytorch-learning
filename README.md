# My first Pytorch's deep learning approach using Jupyter Notebooks

Notebooks extracted through reading of "Deep Learning with PyTorch" book.

- Introduction to tensors.
- Usage of pretrained recognition networks.
- Utilization of pretrained CycleGAN networks.
- Transformation of real world data (e.g images) into PyTorch tensors.
